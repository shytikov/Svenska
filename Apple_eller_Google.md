# Apple or Google?

It's very hard to answer on question, which phone is better: iPhone or Android. Just because the question itself is not correct. To observe whole picture we always need to specify at least:

* which versions of operation systems we're comparing;
* which phone generations we're talking about;
* for which purpose phone is going to to be used;

And we should not forget, that all discussions on this topic are deeply subjective.

Let's start from first point — operation systems. iOS was was first, it was released in March 2008. Android came second. It was released in September same year. But we need to admit that functionality that first versions of both operation systems was not great. There was no support of application in iOS at all and Android API was far from perfection. Situation become better with time: Apple added support of phone applications, and Google managed to make their API stable. At iOS version 6 and Android version 4 I think systems become equaly usable and friendly to users. But than Steve Jobs died and new version of iOS came without his supervision and it was fail. iOS version 7, 8 and 9 has no new important improvement, less friendly to users, has worse design and performance. While Android 5, 6 and upcoming version 7 is constantly improving in all areas.

If we would talk about hardware, Apple phones are almost aways win competition. They have better screens and CPU than Android phones, but they also always several times more expensive. In the past iPhones performed better than Android phones, and had better batteries, but now it's not true anymore — average Android performs better than most iPhone and has more powerful battery.

In terms of usage, due to large amound of developers writing application for Android — almost in all areas it's better to use Android phone for solving tasks. One exception is sound processing. In this area Android fails completly. For this puprose it's better to use iPhone.

Due to the last advantage I bought iPhone I'm using now. Since I play guitar and use phone as portable aplifier, iPhone was the only choice. But despite this I'm going to switch to Android soon, since I cannot stand iPhone weaknesses.
