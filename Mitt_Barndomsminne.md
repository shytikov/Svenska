# Mitt ljusaste barndomsminne

I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine. And my entire childhood was spent there. Kyiv is a big city, the capital, so many things was going on there — same as in many cities and many countries. But one thing I have experienced there, was so simple, so bright and so unique, could not be found and experienced anywhere else in the world. This story is about exactly this day somewhere around late spring 30 years ago.

I have already forgot how this day started, I don't remember how it ended as well. But what happened in the noon seems to be will stay with me forever. 

It was Sunday and chestnuts was in bloom. Best time to explore Kyiv! And my mom took me on a regular walk in the center of the city. We roamed around central square, we were following small streets of old town. I was running on sidewalks making pigeons fly away. For 3 hours in the row.

Finally I get really tired and started being hungry. Luckily right across the street we saw small cafe and went there.

Menu in that cafe was very simple: fresh bagels with poppy-seed and hot boiled milk right from suburbs farm.

I don't know, either these bagel and glass of milk was so tasty or I was just so tired, but memories about this moment still with me after 30 years.

I remember sun in the windows and tall chairs and tables in the room. I remember smell of absolutely fresh milk and just baked bagels. Through I don't remember address of that cafe to take my kids there.

I bet it would be nice to take them to walk in Kyiv with chestnuts in bloom, let them run on sidewalks, drink fresh milk, ate warm bagels and sleep on their mom knees on their way home.

As I did 30 years ago.
